SnapMotion is an SDK for building design editors. While there are many powerful JavaScript frameworks and tools that can help you make a canvas editor, almost all of them are “low-level” and would require writing a lot of code to build a full-featured canvas editor app.

## Features

Here are some key features I would highlight for Snapmotion as an SDK for creating graphic and video editors:

- **Canvas Rendering** - Provides a flexible canvas via FabricJS for rendering graphics/video and handling user interactions.

- **Scene Management** - Allows building editors with multiple scenes/pages for designs and storyboards.

- **Object Primitives** - APIs for easily adding and manipulating different object types like text, shapes, images.

- **History Support** - Robust undo/redo capabilities to edit designs and sequences.

- **Media Support** - APIs for importing, manipulating, and exporting media assets.

- **Animation Tools** - Timeline, keyframes, and other tools for creating animations and sequences.

- **Cross-Platform** - Support for building web, mobile, and desktop editors using React and Electron.

- **Intuitive UI** - Canvas interactions, components, and guides to enable intuitive creation interfaces.

## Structure

A SnapMotion editor contains the following Structure:

- **Design** - Represents the full design document. Contains multiple scenes.
- **Scene** - A single page or artboard in the design. Contains design objects.
- **History** - Tracks changes to scenes to enable undo/redo capabilities.
- **Canvas** - Renders scenes using FabricJS canvas.
- **State** - Global state management for editor data.

## How it works

At a high level, SnapMotion provides a central SnapMotion class that orchestrates the core editor components and functionality.

When creating a new SnapMotion instance, it initializes the Canvas, sets up the State module, and loads the initial design data.

The do() method is used to dispatch actions, which call the corresponding action handler methods on the SnapMotion instance. For example:

```ts
snapMotion.do({
  action: "CREATE_SCENE",
});
```

This would call the `CREATE_SCENE` method on SnapMotion to handle creating a new scene.

The EventsManager is used to listen for and handle events from the Canvas and other sources.

The State module provides centralized state management for the editor data.
